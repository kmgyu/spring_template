# Spring Template Project

This project aims to serve as a **long-term maintainable backend template**.
Instead of blindly chasing the very latest versions, we focus on **stability and compatibility** by choosing versions that are slightly below bleeding edge.

---

## Core Stack

* **Java 21 (LTS)**
* **Spring Boot 3.5.x**

    * Close to the latest, but stable
    * Long-term support guaranteed

---

## Build & Environment

* **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)**

    * More IDE-friendly than Groovy
    * Provides better error detection and autocomplete in IntelliJ

* ~~**Docker (planned)**~~

    * Support for containerized deployments
    * Future plan: Dockerfile for image building

---

## Database & ORM

* **JPA (Hibernate 6.x)**

    * Object-oriented data access
    * Improves maintainability and scalability

* ~~**QueryDSL (planned, need to know 'bout this lol)**~~

    * Type-safe query construction
    * Clean handling of complex query conditions

---

## Project Goals

* Provide a **reliable and non-legacy template** for the long run
* Ensure both **stability and compatibility** across environments
* Offer a **ready-to-use starting point** for new Spring Boot projects
